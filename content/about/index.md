### Hello ðŸ‘‹ â€“  I'm Sharma Elanthiraiyan!
  

- I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mokriya.com">Mokriya</a> as an iOS Engineer.
- Recently, I am catching up on what's new in SwiftUI and Swift. Current focus is on concurrency in Swift.
- I contribute in Stackoverflow and I go through open source (iOS) projects and try to learn/contribute. 
- I speak Tamil and English. Currently, I am learning Hindi.
